Now with all of these optimization, it is time to actually compare a dummy
path tracer algorithm implementation versus an optimized one. On Figure~\ref{table:final_perfs}
actually compares the rendering time performance per rays. For the optimizations,
we have chosen to activate the following optimizations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Octree sub-node access lists with the node's sub-nodes mask implementation;
    \item Octree tiny nodes pruning;
    \item Coherent Interleaved Path Tracing;
    \item Octree one loop browsing;
    \item Octree consecutives sub-nodes.
\end{itemize}
