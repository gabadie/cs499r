Now with all of these optimization, it is time to actually compare a dummy
path tracer algorithm implementation versus a specifically optimized one for GPU.
On Figure~\ref{table:final_perfs}, we can actually witness the massive overall
performance improvment, on all scenes. The activated optimizations for this
performance comparaison are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Octree sub-node access lists with the node's sub-nodes mask implementation;
    \item Octree tiny nodes pruning;
    \item Coherent Interleaved Path Tracing;
    \item Octree one loop browsing only for the spheres, since the other scenes
        don't have many meshes;
    \item Octree consecutives sub-nodes.
\end{itemize}
