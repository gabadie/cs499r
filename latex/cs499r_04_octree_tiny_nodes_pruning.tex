Since primitives (either a mesh in the scene octree or a triangle in a mesh
octree) are referenced in only on octree node, they are assigned to one,
depending its space location, and its dimension. That means small primitives
might fell lonely in one octree node. But browsing octree's node has time cost.
So this idea of this optimization is only to recursively prunes octree's leaf
that have less than $N$ primitives.
